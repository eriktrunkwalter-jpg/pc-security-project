# FINAL SYSTEM REPORT
# Generated by Trae AI

## 1. System Stability Fixes (Post-Crash Analysis)
- **Crash Cause:** `Hypervisor launch failed` (Event ID 41).
- **Diagnosis:** Virtualization Based Security (VBS) was enforced via registry, but BIOS Virtualization (VMX) is disabled/unavailable. This caused a boot loop.
- **Fix Applied:** Disabled forced VBS enforcement in Registry (`HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard`).
- **Result:** System boot should now be stable.

## 2. BitLocker Encryption Status
- **Method:** XTS-AES 256-bit (Maximum Security).
- **Status:** Fully Encrypted (Verified by User).
- **Progress:** 100% Completed.
- **Action Required:** None. System is fully protected.

## 3. Security Hardening Status
- **Network:** DNS secured via Cloudflare/Quad9.
- **Privacy:** Telemetry & Tracking Disabled.
- **Apps:** Spotify explicitly allowed through Firewall; "TraeMalware" test service removed.
- **Data:** Secure Vault installed.

## 4. Final Steps
1. **Reboot:** One final reboot is recommended to confirm stability.
2. **BIOS (Optional):** If you want VBS/Core Isolation features, enable "Intel VT-x" or "AMD-V" in your BIOS settings later.
